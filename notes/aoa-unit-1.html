1.1 Review of Algorithm

An algorithm is a step-by-step process or set of rules to solve a specific problem.

Characteristics of an Algorithm:

Input: It can take zero or more inputs.

Output: It produces at least one output.

Definiteness: Each step is precisely defined.

Finiteness: It terminates after a finite number of steps.

Effectiveness: Each operation must be basic enough to be carried out.

Example:
Letâ€™s take an algorithm to add two numbers:

Input two numbers, a and b.
Perform addition: sum = a + b.
Output the value of sum.
